# MiniMax MCP Tools Integration

MiniMax provides powerful MCP tools that enhance your development workflow with real-time information and visual analysis capabilities.

## Available Tools

### `web_search`
**Purpose**: Search the internet for real-time information

### `understand_image`
**Purpose**: Analyze images, screenshots, UI mockups, and diagrams using Vision Language Model

---

## web_search Tool

### Description
Performs web searches similar to Google Search, returning structured results with titles, links, snippets, and dates.

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | Yes | Search query (3-5 keywords recommended) |

### When to Use

**Use `web_search` for:**
- Current API documentation or changelog information
- Recent solutions to errors or issues
- Security advisories and CVEs
- Library/framework updates not in training data
- Best practices that may have evolved
- Version-specific documentation

**Don't use for:**
- Information clearly available in the codebase
- Well-established concepts that don't change
- Personal opinions or recommendations

### Best Practices

#### 1. Use 3-5 Specific Keywords
```
Good: "React 19 useOptimistic hook example 2025"
Bad:  "how to use react hooks"
```

#### 2. Add Dates for Time-Sensitive Queries
```
Good: "Next.js 15 app router changes December 2024"
Bad:  "Next.js router"
```

#### 3. Include Version Numbers
```
Good: "TypeScript 5.3 satisfies operator"
Bad:  "TypeScript new features"
```

#### 4. Change Keywords if No Results
If initial search returns poor results, reformulate:
```
Original: "react server components streaming"
Retry:    "RSC streaming SSR Next.js 14"
```

### Example Usage Patterns

#### Finding Documentation
```
<think>
User is asking about a feature in React 19 that I may not have current info on.
I should search for the latest documentation.
</think>

→ web_search("React 19 use hook async data fetching 2024")
```

#### Debugging Errors
```
<think>
User has an error message I don't immediately recognize.
Let me search for recent solutions.
</think>

→ web_search("Next.js 14 NEXT_REDIRECT error build time")
```

#### Security Advisories
```
<think>
Before recommending this library, I should check for recent security issues.
</think>

→ web_search("lodash security vulnerability CVE 2024")
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "organic": [
    {
      "title": "Result title",
      "link": "https://example.com/page",
      "snippet": "Brief description or excerpt",
      "date": "Publication date"
    }
  ],
  "related_searches": [
    {"query": "Related search suggestion"}
  ]
}
```

## understand_image Tool

### Description
Analyzes images using a Vision Language Model (VLM) to extract information, describe content, and answer questions about visual elements.

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | What to analyze or extract from the image |
| `image_source` | string | Yes | URL or file path to the image |

### Supported Formats
- ✅ JPEG / JPG
- ✅ PNG
- ✅ WebP
- ❌ PDF
- ❌ GIF
- ❌ PSD
- ❌ SVG

### When to Use

**Use `understand_image` for:**
- Analyzing screenshots of UI issues
- Reading error messages from images
- Understanding architecture diagrams
- Interpreting flowcharts or wireframes
- Extracting text from screenshots
- Debugging visual layout problems
- Understanding UI mockups before implementation

### Prompt Examples

#### For UI Screenshots
```
"Describe the UI layout, components, and styling of this interface"
"What interactive elements are visible in this screenshot?"
"Identify any accessibility issues in this design"
```

#### For Error Messages
```
"What error message is displayed in this screenshot?"
"Explain the error and suggest potential fixes"
"What stack trace information is visible?"
```

#### For Code Screenshots
```
"Explain the code shown in this image"
"What programming language is this and what does it do?"
"Identify any bugs or issues in this code"
```

#### For Architecture Diagrams
```
"Describe the system architecture shown in this diagram"
"What are the main components and how do they interact?"
"Identify the data flow in this architecture"
```

#### For Wireframes/Mockups
```
"Describe all the UI elements in this wireframe"
"What user interactions are implied by this design?"
"List the components I would need to build this interface"
```

### Best Practices

#### 1. Use Specific Prompts
```
Good: "What CSS properties might be causing the button to overflow its container?"
Bad:  "What's wrong with this?"
```

#### 2. Ask for What You Need
```
Good: "Extract all the text visible in this error dialog, including button labels"
Bad:  "Tell me about this image"
```

#### 3. Handle File Paths Correctly
Remove `@` prefix if present:
```
Good: "/Users/name/Desktop/screenshot.png"
Bad:  "@/Users/name/Desktop/screenshot.png"
```

#### 4. Always Use the Analysis Result
The tool returns valuable information - incorporate it into your response.

### Example Usage Patterns

#### Debugging UI Issues
```
<think>
User shared a screenshot of a layout problem.
Let me analyze it to understand the issue.
</think>

→ understand_image(
    prompt="Describe the layout issue visible in this screenshot. What CSS properties might be causing the problem?",
    image_source="/path/to/screenshot.png"
  )
```

#### Understanding Error Messages
```
<think>
User shared a screenshot of an error.
I need to read and understand the error message.
</think>

→ understand_image(
    prompt="Read the complete error message and stack trace. What is the root cause?",
    image_source="https://example.com/error-screenshot.jpg"
  )
```

#### Implementing from Mockups
```
<think>
User provided a design mockup to implement.
Let me understand the structure and components.
</think>

→ understand_image(
    prompt="List all UI components in this mockup. Describe the layout structure, spacing, colors, and typography.",
    image_source="/path/to/mockup.png"
  )
```

## Tool Chaining Patterns

### Pattern 1: Image → Code Fix
```
1. Analyze screenshot of bug with understand_image
2. Identify the issue from analysis
3. Search for solutions with web_search if needed
4. Implement the fix
```

### Pattern 2: Diagram → Implementation
```
1. Analyze architecture diagram with understand_image
2. Extract component structure
3. Search for best practices with web_search
4. Create implementation plan
```

### Pattern 3: Error → Solution
```
1. Read error from screenshot with understand_image
2. Search for solutions with web_search
3. Apply fix and verify
```

### Pattern 4: Mockup → Component
```
1. Analyze mockup with understand_image
2. Identify UI patterns and components
3. Search for component libraries if applicable
4. Implement the design
```

## Error Handling

### web_search Errors
- If no results: Try different keywords
- If rate limited: Wait and retry
- If irrelevant results: Refine query with more specific terms

### understand_image Errors
- If format not supported: Request a supported format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- If file not found: Verify the path and ensure file exists
- If analysis unclear: Ask with a more specific prompt

## Integration with Cursor Tools

### Combine with codebase_search
```
1. Use web_search to find current best practices
2. Use codebase_search to find existing patterns
3. Combine both for informed implementation
```

### Combine with read_file
```
1. Use understand_image to analyze error screenshot
2. Use read_file to examine the relevant code
3. Apply fix using search_replace
```

### Combine with run_terminal_cmd
```
1. Use web_search to find the correct command/package
2. Use run_terminal_cmd to install/execute
3. Verify results
```
